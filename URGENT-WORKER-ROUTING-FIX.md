# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Worker Routing Issue Diagnosis

## The Problem
Your terminal shows components being generated, but the progress counter isn't updating. This suggests:

1. **Terminal logs** are coming from the **autonomous worker** (generating components)
2. **Progress counter** is coming from the **enhanced worker** (serving the frontend)
3. **They're not syncing** because they might be:
   - Using different KV namespaces
   - One worker is not deployed
   - Routes are pointing to wrong worker

## Quick Diagnosis

### Check Your Cloudflare Dashboard:

1. **Go to Workers & Pages**
2. **List ALL your workers:**
   - `krypt-autonomous` (should be generating components)
   - `cloudflare-worker-enhanced` or similar (should serve frontend API)

3. **Check ROUTES for each worker:**
   - One should handle `kryptterminal.com/api/*`
   - Which one is handling the frontend API calls?

### The Fix

You likely need to:

**Option A: Route frontend to autonomous worker**
- Change kryptterminal.com/api/* to point to the autonomous worker
- The autonomous worker has all the same API endpoints

**Option B: Sync between workers**
- Make sure both workers use the SAME KV namespace IDs
- Ensure they're reading/writing to the same keys

## Immediate Test

Open your browser console on kryptterminal.com and run:
```javascript
fetch('/api/progress').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```

Compare the result with what your autonomous worker returns.

## Most Likely Solution

The autonomous worker is generating components but the frontend is still calling the enhanced worker for progress, and they're not synced.

**Fix:** Point kryptterminal.com/api/* to the autonomous worker since it has all the APIs and is actively generating components.
